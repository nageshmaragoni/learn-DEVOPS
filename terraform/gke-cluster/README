I am using GCP to create Kubernetes cluster. This folder consists of 3 files
1. main.tf "which consists of the configuration to create a GKE cluster, This configuration will create a cluster IN 'asia-south1' region with max=4 nodes which are e2-small."
NOTE: The created cluster will allow all the traffic from internet.
2. output.tf "This file is created to display/provide the name of the created cluster"
3. variables.tf "This file consists of all the variables required for the above 2 files. Any parameter changes should be made in this file only, without effecting the actual configuration."

After reaching the folder where this 3 files are stored run the following commands
1. terraform init (this will initialise the terraform in the current folder and downloads all the required dependencies.)
2. terraform validate (this command checks the code for its validity and possible errors.)
3. terraform plan (this command is used to check what are the things that are going to be created, modified, etc.)
4. terraform apply -auto-approve ( terraform apply will display all the changes, modifications that will happen and asks for confirmation.)
