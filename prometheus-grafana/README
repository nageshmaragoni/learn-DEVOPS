There are multiple ways with which we can install PROMETHEUS & GRAFANA.
1. Install them from official website on to local and configure them. But, it is not a suggested method because it requires lots of effort. Because it involves large number of files to create and deploy and monitor them.
2. With the help of Prometheus operator with the help of HELM Charts. 
3. Prometheus monitoring stack.

The Kubernetes Prometheus monitoring stack has the following components.

Prometheus Server
Alert Manager
Grafana

After creating a cluster, create a NAMESPACE monitoring with "kubectl create ns monitoring"
And switch to the monitoring namespace with "kubectl config set-context --current --namespace=monitoring"
Check the current namespace with "kubectl config view --minify | grep namespace"

Create a folder. For example "kubernetes-prometheus"
In order to deploy Prometheus monitoring stack a lot of deployments, services, configuration files, Cluster-role and role-binding are to be deployed. So, place all the files in the above
created folder and just use "kubectl apply -f kubernetes-prometheus" all of the yaml files will be deployed.
I have provided all the files.
